Calculators are not only one of the most useful tools available, but they are
also a great way to understand UI and event processing in an application. In
this problem you will create a calculator that supports basic arithmetic
calculations on integers. 

The styling is up to you so use your imagination and get creative! You might
also find it worth your time to experiment with the calculator app on your
mobile device to better understand basic functionality and edge cases.
